# Week-1-Homework

We were provided a functional website, however, the source HTML and CSS were messy and inefficient.

For this assignment, I improved the organization, structure, and accessibility of this website's source code.

I replaced div tags with semantic HTML elements, and added comments to the CSS and HTML files.

I added alt tags to all the images, to improve accessibility for screen readers.

I consolidated the CSS classes, and added a title to the website. 

Overall, the source code is now much easier to read and understand, and the website is much more accessible for screen readers.

The purpose of this project was to better understand how to improve on code that has already been written. By working with messy code, I now understand the importance of comments and semantic HTML elements.
